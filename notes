Directions are read using:
in Rx 0x0f
com Rx
andi Rx 0x33

(that's PINF bits 0,1,4,5)

The bits correspond to the buttons as follows:
0x01 = down
0x02 = up
0x10 = left
0x20 = right

The read at 23be seems to be legitimately used, but it is split up.
The com and andi happen at 2422.
I'll need to make some space around there to put 6 consecutive bytes...
